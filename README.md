# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. I work on these problems in my free time during evenings after work, purely for fun and as a way to practice coding. 

These solutions are **not intended for competition or leaderboard rankings** and should not be used as a guide for others participating in the event. They are simply my own approach to problem-solving.

Feel free to browse through the code, but please keep in mind:
- The solutions might not be the most efficient or elegant.
- Some challenges may remain incomplete depending on my availability.

Happy coding!
